## What is a code kata?
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

## Simple katas
In any discipline we have a different level of exercises, in this set, you will find a collection of simple programming katas that I have tested and implemented.

## Katas Criteria

1. Can be implemented and tested in less than 10 minutes.
2. Follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
3. Illustrates a common but interesting programming problem.
4. The solution is well known.

# Hands-On

Here are all the details needed in order to *get* the code, *build*, *test* and contribute to this project.

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

# Reference
I got most of the challenges from this article as a reference and take each challenge initial set into the wiki for guidance, I didn't use the solutions in the same article since it defeats the porpouse of level up my Javascript skills, instead I use my own implementations which could change or improve as I continue working with this repository in the next iterations.
